##### The above design is a simple Parental Control if the Youtube and Madrasati switches are ON then allow the user to access respective domains otherwise print access denied. 

##### Only the kid name given in the text field under Parental Control section can unlock the device, so if the name matches between two text fields and grant access else deny them to unlock the phone. 

##### Hint: Use Xcode Interface Builder (Storyboard) and/or UIViewController class to change objects properties and to call built-in methods for each object.
